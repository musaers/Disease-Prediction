# Predictive Modeling and Data Visualization in Healthcare

## Project Overview
The objective of this project is to develop an advanced predictive modeling and data visualization tool for healthcare professionals. This system will analyze historical patient data to predict potential diseases based on symptoms and visualize the distribution of these diseases for better diagnostic support.

## Key Features
- **Disease Prediction Model:** Utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of various diseases based on patient history and current symptoms.
- **Data Visualization Dashboard:** Interactive dashboards that display disease trends and symptom correlations.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simplified UI for healthcare professionals to input data and interpret results effectively.

## Technologies Used
- **Backend:** .NET 8.0 Core for robust server-side operations.
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript with Chart.js for dynamic data visualization.
- **Database:** SQL for data storage, retrieval, and management.
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn for model development and predictive analytics.

## Project Architecture
1. **Data Layer:** SQL database for storing historical patient records and real-time input data.
2. **Backend Layer:** API development using .NET 8.0 Core to process data, handle business logic, and communicate with the frontend.
3. **Frontend Layer:** Responsive web interface built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, integrated with Chart.js for visualization.
4. **Machine Learning Layer:** Predictive models trained on historical data to identify disease patterns.

## Development Phases
### Phase 1: Data Collection & Preprocessing
- Extract data from existing healthcare databases.
- Clean and normalize data to ensure quality and consistency.

### Phase 2: Model Development
- Apply statistical analyses and machine learning algorithms.
- Train models on historical data to predict diseases.
- Validate model accuracy through cross-validation techniques.

### Phase 3: Frontend & Visualization Development
- Design intuitive user interfaces.
- Implement interactive charts and graphs using Chart.js.
- Ensure compatibility with existing healthcare IT infrastructure.

### Phase 4: Integration & Testing
- Integrate backend APIs with the frontend.
- Conduct unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing.
- Optimize for performance and security.

### Phase 5: Deployment & Feedback
- Deploy the application in a controlled environment.
- Gather feedback from healthcare professionals.
- Iterate based on feedback to improve functionality and usability.

## Expected Outcomes
- A fully functional predictive analytics tool.
- Enhanced decision-making support for healthcare providers.
- Improved patient outcomes through early detection and preventive care.

## Future Work
- Expand model capabilities to cover a wider range of diseases.
- Implement advanced machine learning techniques for higher accuracy.
- Scale the application for use across multiple healthcare institutions.
